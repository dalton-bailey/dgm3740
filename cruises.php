            <h1>Western Caribbean $1099pp</h1>
            <p class="cruiseText">We don’t have proof, but evidence suggests that the Caribbean was made for cruising.
                This evidence is all around you — you’ll find in the Caribbean air, the sand and the water.
                And with more than 5,000 islands and cays spread across this amazing region, there’s a lot of paradise to see.

            <h1>Mexico $899pp</h1>
            <p class="cruiseText">So close, yet so deliciously far. Mexico might be right down there, but it exists in another world entirely. 
            Experience a whole enchilada’s worth of rich culture and fun on a cruise to Mexico. 
            Each port — including favorites Cozumel, Cabo San Lucas and Puerto Vallarta — contributes its own distinct local flavor to the mix.

            <h1>Catalina Island $649pp</h1>
            <p class="cruiseText">Discover a sunny Southern California playground hidden beyond the Los Angeles horizon, on a Carnival cruise to Catalina Island. Just 22 miles from the mainland, Catalina Island has long been a getaway for savvy city hikers, sun-seekers… and film crews looking for a slice of accessible paradise. Access the breathtaking views from up high on the island’s rugged cliffs, or way down low as you snorkel or scuba the Pacific Ocean waters at Avalon Beach.

            <h1>The Bahamas $1049pp</h1>
            <p class="cruiseText">You know the name, the laid-back attitude and where to find them, but you’ll just have to visit The Bahamas to truly appreciate this classic cruise destination. On this 700-strong string of sun-splashed islands dotting the blue Atlantic, the living’s easy. (And it’s not bad on a Bahamas cruise either!) The central port of Nassau is the bustling capital of the country — “bustling” is a relative term, of course — while Freeport is all chill, all the time.
